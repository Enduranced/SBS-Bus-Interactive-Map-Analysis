SBS Transit routes are observed to be concentrated towards the east side of Singapore, a pattern of bus stops along the MRT lines. It appears the presence of a MRT station may have more influence over the number of bus stops than the population density in an area. Perhaps for this reason, the majority of bus stops appear to be within the core central region and rest of central region, where there is a higher concentration of MRT stations. 
One reason for this observation may be that MRT stations are often, if not always, accompanied by bus stops or bus interchanges, creating the opportunity for the bus operators to map their routes to the MRTs. By passing SBS bus routes through these stations, SBS would benefit from a higher ridership from those making the last mile journey from MRT to their destinations. Whereas had the SBS bus routes been planned without stopping by a MRT station, SBS would be missing out on these commuters who use buses to connect to MRT stations. Therefore, it would make commercial sense for SBS to route as many buses to stop at MRT stations as possible without cannibalising their own market share. This would mean more bus lines are connected to these bus stops. Hence, resulting in a pattern of bus routes clustering around MRT stations. 
the downside to this clustering effect is there may be areas that have a relatively large population but few MRT stations, such as Punggol and Sengkang that are largely served by LRT lines. The density of bus stops in Punngol is much lower than even Pasir Ris which has a lower population. Given the capacity of LRT lines struggle to cope with demand on peak hours, having bus lines along the LRT stations may prove an attractive switch for riders, and a commercial opportunity for SBS.

## 5 Key insights of data:

1. SBS has services a total of 293 day busservices
2.  It's longest busride is a loop service by 70M that starts from Yio Chu Kang Int. (https://www.transitlink.com.sg/eservice/eguide/service_route.php?service=70M)
3.  SBS covers a total of 3530 busstops out of a total of 5008 (Which is about 70% of Singapore's Busstops available)
4.  The most popular (Non-Interchange busstop) that has the most SBS bus passing through is Blk 401 Tampines Ave 7 (76191) with a total of 16 SBS bus services
5.  The most densely populated subzone in Singapore is Bedok coming in at 279380 people (Base on 2015 publicly available data)
